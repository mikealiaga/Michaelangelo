## Description
- Linguini's Recipes is a cooking web application. It was designed with the idea that everyone can cook. The user-friendly interface makes it possible for anyone to cook the dish that he or she likes best.
- This web application guides the user by providing clear information about the time, the level of difficulty, the tools and the ingredients needed to prepare each dish.  
- Once you have everything you need, step-by-step instructions guide you through the recipe. The application also has a timer. This will help you calculate the exact time you need for your preparation.

> [!NOTE]

- This web application has been created using HTML, JavaScript and a number of elements from the Bootstrap library for the CSS.

## Instructions
- Navigate to www.placeholder.com
Once you are on the landing page, you will see several images with different recipes.

- Each is identified by a different colour tag. Green for easy, blue for intermediate and red for hard. You will also have an estimate of how long the recipe will take to prepare.

- Clicking on the 'Cook Recipe' button will take you to the recipe you have chosen.

- Once inside the recipe, you will see two lists on the left of the screen. This list shows you the ingredients and tools you will need to make the recipe. Below the main image, you will see a progress bar that will increase as you click on the check boxes. Below this bar, you will see the detailed instructions to do the recipe.

> [!TIP]
- Always remember to cook with care. Wear gloves when handling hot items, wear an apron to protect your clothes, and keep the kitchen well ventilated.
Enjoy your meals and keep the balance between healthy and delicious!

- Finally, we've got a Timer, which will help us to know the exact cooking time you need. You can set the time as described in the instructions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
- This timer is mainly intended to be used specifically for the cooking time of the dish. This timer does not take into account the time needed to prepare the food, nor the time needed after it has been cooked, if the food needs to cool down, for example.

- Finally, enjoy the dish you've prepared!

> [!NOTE]
- This website will continue to grow and over time we will add more features like timers, more photos, more recipes, nutritional information for each dish and the ability for our users to save their own recipes and even include them in their app. We appreciate your feedback.

- Thank you for using Linguini's!!!
